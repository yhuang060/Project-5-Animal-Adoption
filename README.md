# Project-5-Animal-Adoption
How could we improve adoption rate?<br/>

Motivation: <br/>
 - Facts about U.S. Animal Shelters:
    - 6.5 Million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year
    - 1.5 Million shelter animals are euthanized per year<br/>
  
If homes can be found for these animals, we may be able to reduce the Euthanasia rate for these precious lives. I believe that this can be achieved by showcasing specific types of animals with a higher risk of Euthanasia. I am motivated to complete and showcase this project..so that we can increase adoption rate and provide more assistance for the shelters.
